# TgFileSharingBot

A sophisticated Telegram bot designed to store, manage, and share files with users through a token-based access system. It leverages multiple channels for different functionalities and integrates with TMDB for rich media metadata and a URL shortener for token links.

## Core Concepts & How It Works

The bot operates using a multi-channel system and a token verification process for file access:

1.  **File Ingestion (Owner):**
    *   The bot owner sends video or document files directly to the bot in a private chat.
    *   The bot automatically copies these files to a dedicated **Database Channel (`DB_CHANNEL_ID`)** for storage.
    *   Alternatively, the owner can use the `/index` command to process a range of messages already existing in the `DB_CHANNEL_ID`.

2.  **File Processing & Cataloging:**
    *   Files in the `DB_CHANNEL_ID` are processed one by one from a queue.
    *   For each file, the bot:
        *   Extracts/cleans the file name.
        *   Calculates file size and duration (for videos).
        *   Attempts to fetch movie/show poster images from TMDB using the file name.
        *   Creates a new post in the **Update Channel (`UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`)**. This post typically includes the poster (if found) or a thumbnail, file details (name, size, duration), and a crucial "Send in DM" button.

3.  **User File Access:**
    *   Users discover files by browsing the `UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`.
    *   To get a file, a user clicks the "Send in DM" button associated with a file post. This button is a deep link (`https://telegram.dog/YOUR_BOT_USERNAME?start=FILE_ID_FROM_DB_CHANNEL`).
    *   Clicking the button opens a private chat with the bot and sends the `/start <FILE_ID>` command.

4.  **Token Verification System:**
    *   Before a user can receive a file, they must have a valid, verified token.
    *   **Requesting a Token:** If a user doesn't have a token or their token is invalid/expired, they are prompted to get one. The bot provides two buttons:
        1.  "üéüÔ∏è Get Token": This links to a **shortened URL** (generated by `shorterner.py`) which, when opened, sends a command like `/start token_UNIQUE_TOKEN_STRING` back to the bot.
        2.  "How to get verified ‚úÖ": This links to a tutorial message (e.g., explaining they might need to complete an action on the shortened link page before getting the `token_UNIQUE_TOKEN_STRING`).
    *   **Verifying a Token:** When the user sends `/start token_UNIQUE_TOKEN_STRING`, the bot checks if this string matches the one it generated for the user.
    *   **Access Granted:** If the token is verified:
        *   The token is valid for a duration defined by `TOKEN_TIMEOUT`.
        *   The user can download up to `DAILY_LIMIT` files.
        *   The requested file is then sent to the user from the `DB_CHANNEL_ID`.

5.  **Logging:**
    *   The bot uses a **Log Channel (`LOG_CHANNEL_ID`)** to post operational messages (startup, errors reported to owner) and logs certain user actions (like token verification attempts).
    *   The "How to get verified ‚úÖ" tutorial message (ID specified by `TUT_ID`) is also hosted in this `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`.

## Features

*   **Owner File Upload:** Easy file submission by sending to the bot.
*   **Automatic Indexing:** Files are processed and posted to the update channel.
*   **TMDB Integration:** Fetches posters for movies and TV shows.
*   **Token-Based Access Control:**
    *   Users need to verify a token to download files.
    *   Tokens have a configurable timeout (`TOKEN_TIMEOUT`).
    *   Daily download limit per user (`DAILY_LIMIT`).
*   **URL Shortener for Token Links:** Uses an external URL shortener for the token acquisition links.
*   **Channel-Based Organization:**
    *   `DB_CHANNEL_ID`: Secure file storage.
    *   `UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`: Public-facing channel for file discovery.
    *   `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`: Bot operational logs and tutorial message.
*   **User Management:** Tracks users in a MongoDB database for features like broadcasting.
*   **Broadcast Functionality:** Owner can send messages to all bot users.
*   **Log Retrieval:** Owner can fetch the bot's `log.txt` file.
*   **Restart & Update:** Owner can restart and update the bot via commands.
*   **Flask Web App:** Includes a minimal Flask app, likely for health checks on hosting platforms.

## Channel Configuration Explained

To use this bot, you **must** create three Telegram channels and configure the bot with their IDs:

1.  **`DB_CHANNEL_ID` (Database Channel):**
    *   **Type:** Private Channel.
    *   **Bot Role:** Administrator (with at least 'Post Messages' and 'Edit Messages' permissions).
    *   **Purpose:** This is where the bot stores all the original media files you send to it. Users do not directly interact with this channel.
    *   **Example ID:** `-100xxxxxxxxxx`

2.  **`UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID` (Updates/Public Channel):**
    *   **Type:** Public or Private Channel (Public recommended for easier discovery).
    *   **Bot Role:** Administrator (with at least 'Post Messages' permissions).
    *   **Purpose:** This is where the bot posts formatted messages about the available files (e.g., movie poster, file name, size, and a "Send in DM" button). Users will browse this channel to find files.
    *   **Example ID:** `-100yyyyyyyyyy` (if private) or `@yourchannelusername` (if public, but the bot needs the numerical ID for sending).

3.  **`LOG_CHANNEL_ID` (Log Channel):**
    *   **Type:** Private Channel.
    *   **Bot Role:** Administrator (with at least 'Post Messages' and 'Read Message History' permissions, as it needs to copy the `TUT_ID` message).
    *   **Purpose:** The bot sends operational logs, status updates, and some error reports here. It also hosts the tutorial message for token verification (its Message ID is set in `TUT_ID`).
    *   **Example ID:** `-100zzzzzzzzzz`

**Important:**
*   The bot *must* be an administrator in all these channels with the necessary permissions.
*   Channel IDs for private channels are negative numbers (e.g., `-1001234567890`). You can get these IDs by forwarding a message from the channel to a bot like `@JsonDumpBot` or `@MissRose_bot` (use `/id` in the channel where Rose is an admin).

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Git
*   MongoDB instance

### Manual Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TgFileSharingBot.git
    cd TgFileSharingBot-main
    ```

2.  **Create `config.env`:**
    Copy `config_sample.env` to `config.env` and fill in your details:
    ```bash
    cp config_sample.env config.env
    nano config.env # Or your preferred editor
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Channels:**
    *   Create the three required Telegram channels (`DB_CHANNEL_ID`, `UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`, `LOG_CHANNEL_ID`).
    *   Make your bot an admin in all three channels with necessary permissions.
    *   Add the `TUT_ID` message in your `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` (e.g., a message explaining how to click the link from the shortener and what to expect). Get its message ID and put it in `config.env`.

5.  **Run the bot:**
    The `CMD` in the Dockerfile is `["sh", "start.sh"]`. If a `start.sh` is not provided in your version, you'd typically run `bot.py`. Assuming `start.sh` contains `python3 bot.py`:
    ```bash
    sh start.sh
    # OR if start.sh is missing/simple:
    # python3 bot.py
    ```
    (Note: The provided `start.sh` is not in the file list, but the Dockerfile calls it. If it's simple, it might just be `python3 bot.py & python3 app.py`. For a production setup, `gunicorn app:app` would be better for the Flask part if it were more complex.)

### Docker Setup

1.  **Prepare `config.env`:** Ensure your `config.env` file is in the `TgFileSharingBot-main` directory and correctly filled.
2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t tgfilesharingbot .
    ```
3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --env-file ./config.env --name filebot tgfilesharingbot
    ```
    (Note: The Dockerfile copies `config.env` if `CONFIG_FILE_URL` is not used effectively. It's generally better to pass env vars directly or use `--env-file` if your Dockerfile doesn't handle `config.env` robustly via `CONFIG_FILE_URL`.)
    The current Dockerfile *copies* `requirements.txt` and then `COPY . .`, so if `config.env` is present at build time, it *could* be copied in, but it's better practice to manage secrets outside the image. The `CONFIG_FILE_URL` mechanism in `config.py` is an attempt to fetch it at runtime.

## Key Commands

### Owner Commands (Private Chat with Bot)

*   **(Send File):** Send any video or document file directly to the bot. It will be copied to `DB_CHANNEL_ID` and then processed for `UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`.
*   `/index`: Prompts for a start and end message ID from `DB_CHANNEL_ID` to batch process/re-process files.
*   `/cancel`: Cancels an ongoing `/index` operation.
*   `/broadcast` (as a reply to a message): Broadcasts the replied message to all users in the database.
*   `/users`: Shows the total number of users in the database.
*   `/log`: Sends the `log.txt` file to the owner.
*   `/restart`: Restarts the bot. Pulls updates from `UPSTREAM_REPO` if configured, then restarts the Python process.

### User Commands (Private Chat with Bot)

*   `/start`: Shows a welcome message.
*   `/start <file_id>`: (Usually triggered by the "Send in DM" button from `UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID`) Initiates the file download process, including token verification.
*   `/start token`: (Usually triggered by a button when access is denied) Sends the user a message (copied from `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` via `TUT_ID`) explaining how to get a token, along with a "üéüÔ∏è Get Token" (shortened link) and "How to get verified ‚úÖ" button.
*   `/start token_<unique_token_string>`: (Usually triggered by visiting the shortened token link) Attempts to verify the `unique_token_string`.
